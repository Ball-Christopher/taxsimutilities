Description: This package provides utilities for Random Utility Random Opportunity (RURO) discrete choice modesl of labour supply.  
These include C++ (through Rcpp) functions for estimation, simulation and a range of important functions that are slow in pure R.
Note for earlier versions of R: SSE2 instructions are used, so the compiler flag -msse2 has been added to the MakeVars files.
